# TaskGenerator

**🧠 Personalizing Cognitive Training**

The NeuroRehabLab Task Generator is a software that has been developed with the collaboration of over 20 health professionals that uses computational models of cognitive function to deliver a highly personalized training to each individual. The tasks created with the NeuroRehabLab Task Generator are generated procedurally, that is, they are always different every time they are created.
